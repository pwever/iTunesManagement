# iTunes management script

# Description

A ruby script to handle some iTunes tasks. Especially when dealing with iTunes libraries across multiple machines. This is *anything but userfriendly*, but it allows a couple of tasks I found useful:

* Transfer ratings from one computer to another
* Find songs with broken links
* Copy files from source that are not already part of the destination library
* Find artists with only one song in your library (and optionally with a low rating)

It requires "Remote Apple Events" to be active on both machines.

## Dependencies

* appscript
* ftools
